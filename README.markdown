AVRDude Hex Uploader
====================

This is a simple GUI for the AVRDude microcontroller programming software, written in C#.

There are a few small issues, and the code isn't very well commented at the moment, but that will change as the days go by.

You can download a windows binary by clicking the "[Download](http://github.com/adnbr/AVRDude-Hex-Uploader/downloads)" link in the top right corner of the screen.
